I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University working with Mike West and Alex Volfovsky. I work with (Bayesian)
statistical models to better understand complex data sets, with particular emphasis applications in the social sciences.
Currently, I am developing methods for Bayesian causal forecasting and inference using simultaneous graphical dynamic linear models (SGDLMs) and analyzing the structure
of American political opinions using Bayesian factor models. 

Before attending Duke, I completed a BA in applied mathematics at Harvard. In my free time, I enjoy reading, going to bakeries, and traveling.
