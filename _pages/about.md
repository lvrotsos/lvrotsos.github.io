I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University working with Mike West and Alex Volfovsky. My research interests include Bayesian time series models, factor models, and causal
inference. I am particularly interested in applications in the social sciences. 

Before attending Duke, I completed a BA in applied mathematics at Harvard.
